# Route-Planning-For-Cyclists
This project would designed a route for using bio-inspired algorithms.
The route must traverse a set of locations once and only once and finally return to the starting location, which makes the route planning essentially a travelling salesman problem (TSP).
The main source code is "route_planning_for_cyclists.ipynb"
